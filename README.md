# Stable Diffusion universal notebook
### Jupyter / colab notebook to run the text-to-image Stable Diffusion on Kaggle or Paperspace Gradient

If you would like to run Stable Diffusion on other services than Colab from Google, this notebook will let you do this.
I know there are many other notebooks like that, but I they didn't worked for me on Paperspace Gradient platform, so i created this one.

It's based on: https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion
Orginal Stable Diffusion project: https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion
