# Stable Diffusion universal notebooks
### Jupyter / colab notebook to run the text-to-image Stable Diffusion on Kaggle or Paperspace Gradient
### Added version without NSFW filter

If you would like to run Stable Diffusion on other services than Colab from Google, this notebook will let you do this.
I know there are many other notebooks like that, but they didn't worked for me on Paperspace Gradient platform, so i created this one.

Uncensored version based on fork of diffuser by: https://github.com/WAUthethird
It's based on: https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion
Orginal Stable Diffusion project: https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion
